Let's get the boring biographical stuff out of the way first. My name is Bassel Saleh, I'm a 24 year old living in Austin, Texas, and I'm currently pursuing a PhD in Computational Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CSEM) at the University of Texas. I'm entering my fourth year in the program, and as explained on the [home](/index.html) page, I created this blog to synthesize some of the things I've learned and work on developing a voice that is both technical and personal.

I received two Bachelors of Science, one in physics and the other in computer science, also from the University of Texas. I earned a Masters degree in CSEM after completing the coursework for my PhD program.

## Research Interests

My interests have long lived in the combined space where computation meets interesting physics. A strong theme in my research has been uncertainty quantification, especially as it relates to solving Bayesian inference problems with expensive or innacurate forward models. My main line of research, that which relates to my dissertation, is about solving the inference problem in [gravitational wave analysis](https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2012-4). In short, I get to play with the cool physics of general relativity and black holes, while focusing on the mathematics and methodology of performing numerical inference, namely the problem of sampling probability distributions in high dimensions.

I've also done some work in what is now being called [scientific machine learning](https://www.oden.utexas.edu/research/centers-groups/scientific-machine-learning/#:~:text=Scientific%20Machine%20Learning%20is%20an,science%2C%20engineering%2C%20and%20medicine). Data-driven solutions to modeling complex systems in physics and engineering are gaining in popularity, largely because of how computationally efficient these methods can be. However, in critical systems (e.g. jet plane autopilot, nuclear reactor management, extreme weather prediction), the consequences of innacurate or untrustworthy model predictions can cost billions of dollars and even human lives, so proper quantification of uncertainty is a necessity. This is the second primarily line of my research.

## Personal Interests

Academically, I have a great love for history. I often say if I were barred from having a career in STEM, I would be quite happy reforming myself as a historian. Of course, in this timeline I don't have any formal training and am merely an enthusiastic amateur. Thus, I try to avoid acting like an "armchair historian", a common problem I think, but I imagine I will indulge this hobby on the blog from time to time.

Outside of the high brow stuff, my hobbies include basketball, poker, movies, and just straight chillin, as the kids say. My favorite season is summer because I love to swim and enjoy the sun. In Austin, summer means eating tacos and drinking beer under clear skies, taking a dip in the natural springs and watering holes of central Texas, and hiking through lush greenbelts with my dog, Baloo.

Finally, I love to travel. I've been fortunate enough to visit many countries in my young life, mainly in Europe and the Middle East, and I hope to see much more of the world as I go forward.
