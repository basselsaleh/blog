            "content": "Hello World! . So here it is, my first blog post. More likely than not this particular post will have a short life, and I’ll delete it once I create my first hIgH quAliTy blog post. I have used markdown a little bit before, mostly for making hastily thrown together README files for repos that I never made public anyway. It seems pretty intuitive to use so far. Let’s test some features. . Lists . Big fan of itemization. Thankfully with markdown this is easy to do and make pretty: . For example, this is the first item of a list. | This is the second. | . Code . I don’t imagine I’ll be integrating code too often, but perhaps I’ll make some simple tutorials in the future for libraries I like/workflows I find useful. . Here’s some Python code: . def funky(x): return str(x) + &#39;is a funky monkey&#39; # will a comment show up? print(funky(6)) . Does Julia syntax work? . function julia_funk(x) x = &quot;funkalicious&quot; end # julia comment x = julia_funk(6) . Math . So Jekyll uses a markdown parser called kramdown, which supports MathJax. In theory I can render ( LaTeX ) stuff like so: . [ - frac{ hbar^2}{2m} nabla^2 Psi = i hbar frac{ partial}{ partial t} Psi ] . Pictures . Okay final test for now. Let’s insert a big picture of my face. And then figure out how to make it less big later. . . Turns out it made the picture the perfect size. This is all working so well so far! . I’m currently building the site locally and viewing it in the browser using a Jekyll server inside a docker thing… I just followed some tutorials and set it up. Once I push the changes this should be reflected on the live site. .",
